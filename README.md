# Smart-Water-Level-Monitoring-System

🚰 Smart Water Level Monitoring System using Arduino

This project is a smart water-level monitoring system built using an Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, LCD Display, Relay Module, Push Buttons, and EEPROM storage.
It automatically detects the water level in a tank and controls the pump in AUTO or MANUAL mode. The LCD continuously displays the current water level percentage and pump status.

🧠 Features

1) Measures water level using ultrasonic sensing
2) Automatic pump control based on water level
3) Manual control via push button
4) Saves maximum water height to EEPROM

# LCD display shows:

1) Water level %
2) Pump status (ON/OFF)
3) Current mode (AUTO / MANUAL)

▶️ How to Use

1) Power the system 🟢
2) Press SET button once to store the current tank height to EEPROM
3) System enters AUTO mode pumping based on water percentage
4) Press MODE button to toggle AUTO/MANUAL
5) In MANUAL mode, press SET button to toggle pump ON/OFF
